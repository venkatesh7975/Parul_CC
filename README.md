# 🚀 Parul_CC – Competitive Coding & DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains a **structured collection of Competitive Coding and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems** solved as part of training, practice, and teaching sessions (Parul University – CC).

It is designed to help:

* 📚 **Students** learn DSA step‑by‑step
* 👨‍🏫 **Trainers** demonstrate clean problem‑solving approaches
* 💼 **Interview preparation** for placements and coding rounds

---

## 📌 Repository Overview

**Parul_CC** includes solutions to classical and frequently asked DSA problems such as:

* Stacks & Queues
* Linked Lists
* Binary Search Trees (BST)
* Binary Trees
* Hashing
* Two‑Pointer problems
* Recursion & Traversals

Each problem is stored in a **separate folder**, making it easy to navigate and revise specific topics.

## 💻 Languages Used

This repository includes solutions written in:

* 🐍 **Python**
* ☕ **Java**
* 🔵 **C**
* 🟨 **JavaScript**

The same problem may appear in **multiple languages** to help understand language‑specific implementation differences.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Python

```bash
python filename.py
```

### Java

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

### C

```bash
gcc file.c -o file
./file
```

### JavaScript (Node.js)

```bash
node filename.js
```

> ⚠️ Input is generally taken from **standard input (stdin)** unless specified in the code.

---

## 🧪 Input / Output Format

Most problems follow this pattern:

```
Input:
<number of elements>
<elements>

Output:
<required result>
```

Please check individual files for exact input/output expectations.

## 📚 DSA Cheat Sheets & Practice Resources (Reference)

Use the following **high‑quality DSA cheat sheets and platforms** alongside this repository for revision and practice:

---

### 🔹 Core DSA Cheat Sheets

* **Love Babbar – DSA Sheet (450 Questions)**
  Covers arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, BSTs, graphs, DP.

* **Striver (Take U Forward) – A2Z DSA Sheet**
  Very structured from basics → advanced, excellent for interviews.

* **Blind 75**
  Must‑do problems for FAANG‑level interviews.

* **NeetCode 150**
  Clean explanations + categorized problems.

---

### 🔹 Topic‑Wise Practice Platforms

* **LeetCode** – Interview‑focused problems
* **GeeksforGeeks** – Concepts + practice + theory
* **CodeStudio (Coding Ninjas)** – Structured DSA paths
* **HackerRank** – Beginner‑friendly practice
* **Codeforces** – Competitive programming & logic building

---

### 🔹 Tree & BST Special Practice

* Binary Tree Traversals
* BST Insertion & Validation
* Left / Right / Top / Bottom Views
* Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
* Diameter & Height of Tree

👉 This repository’s problems (like `BuildBST`, `ValidBST`, `leftViewTree`) directly align with these topics.

---

### 🔹 How to Use This Repo with Cheat Sheets (Recommended)

1. Pick a topic from a cheat sheet (e.g., **BST**)
2. Solve 2–3 problems from the sheet
3. Implement the same logic from scratch in this repo
4. Compare with your previous solutions
5. Explain the solution as if teaching someone

This method builds **concept clarity + interview confidence**.
